    <h1>My Experience Studying Computer Science</h1>
    <h2>By Mary Jabro</h2>
    <p>When I was a senior in highschool, I decided to take the course AP Computer science. I learned the only the very basics of Python, however, I also found a love to code.</p>

    <h2>Pursuing a degree in CS </h1>

    <p>As of October of 2023, I am currently a second year student at Wayne State University. I am working towards a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science within the College of Engineering. I have consistently achieved a 4.0 GPA and made the Dean's List each semester I've been enrolled at Wayne State University.</p>
    
    <h2>BE 1600: Introduction to Python</h1>
    <p>This class consisted of learning the basics of Python, of which I had previous knowledge of.</p>
    <h3>Files</h3>

    <p>This is where we learned about loops and traversing through files.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Functions</h3>

    <img src="pythonintro1 Medium.png">

    <p>I also learned how to create my own functions in order to make an interactive program. This one is a Computer Assisted Instruction program where the user can solve different mathematics problems.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Libraries</h3>

    <br>
    <p>Working with turtle and random libraries was a little tricky at first.</p>


    <h2>Problem Solving and Programming: C++</h2>
    <h3>Casino Game</h3>

     <img src="psp2 Medium.png">
     <p>I created games such as this casino game using different functions.</p> 
     <h3>OOP Candy Vendor Class</h3>    
     <img src="psp3 Medium.png">  
     <img src="psp4 Medium.png">
     <p>I got my first glimpse of Object Oriented Programming while creating this virtual candy vendor class program.</p>        
     <h3>Tik Tak Toe</h3>
      <img src="tiktaktoe Medium.png"> 
      <img src="ttt2 Medium.png">
     <img src="ttt1 Medium.png"> 
      <p>I learned to make an interactive 2 player tik tak toe game using functions and array manipulation.</p>    

      <h2>Basic Engineering: Arduino Microcontroller C++</h2>
      <p>In this class, we used the Arduino IDE and a Microcontroller kit in order to allow use to program interactive devices.</p>
      <h3>LED Manipulation</h3>
       <img src="led1 Medium.png"> 
      <img src="led2 Medium.png">
      <img src="led3 Medium.png">
     <p>We used different bytes to make up different symbols to be displayed on the LED Matrix.</p>   
      <img src="led4 Medium.png"> 
      <img src="led5 Medium.png">
     <p>We also used shift registers, wires, and resistors aswell as a program to flicker LEDs on and off.</p>   
      <img src="sim.png"> 
      <img src="sim2 Medium.png">
     <p>And we displayed text on monitors as well as used simulators.</p>   
    <h2>Computer Science 1: C++ Object Oriented Programming</h2>
    <h3>Pointers</h3>
    
    <h3>Memory Management</h3>
    <img src="CS1 Medium.png"> 
    <img src="CS12 Medium.png">
   <p>I learned memory management using object oriented objected programming.</p>
